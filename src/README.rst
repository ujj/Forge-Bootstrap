We at Trigger.io have developed a little example project with a CSS reset,
Backbone and a couple of pages with transitions.

Features
 - Backbone.js
 - CSS reset
 - basic Transitions

Please feel free to base your own projects on this - it's a good starting point
for a new project. The tutorial that references this code is here:
